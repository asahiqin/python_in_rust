## About

### License
This repo use GPL 3.0 license.To be concise,you can edit the code and republish it,what you need is just annotating the original repository

### Original intention
Alright,we just want to take part in the Chinese Primary and Secondary School Student Programming Competition.  
So it's not a project that can use in a production environment.  
You can say this is a boring project because we repeat making wheels.  
However, it's a challanging thing to make a interpreter,isn't it?
